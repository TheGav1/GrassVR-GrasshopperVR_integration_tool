    Contain the relevant Grasshopper files as the examples set-ups and the Grasshopper scripts
3) [Other test file](Other_files/)\
   contain the C# console test files and some Kangaroo related test files that are not directly connected to GrassVR but have been used during analysis of the Grasshopper's components

For the Unity project all the required data is present: the StamVR asset is kept in the project at newer version of the asset could break sone of the developed interaction and input binding elements.\
